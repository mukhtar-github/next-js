# From JavaScript to React

## Updating the UI with JavaScript and DOM Methods

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
  <body>
    <div id='app'></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        // Select the div element with 'app' id
        const app = document.getElementById('app')

        // Create a new H1 element
        const header = document.createElement('h1')

        // Create a new text node for the H1 element
        const headerContent = document.createTextNode(
            'Develop. Preview. Ship. ðŸš€'
        )

        // Append the text to the H1 element
        header.appendChild(headerContent)

        // Place the H1 element inside the div
        app.appendChild(header)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Getting Started with React

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>

    <script type="text/jsx">
      const app = document.getElementById('app')
      ReactDOM.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship. ðŸš€</h1>, app)
    </script>
    
  </body>
</html>
```

## Essential JavaScript for React

In the next sections, you will be introduced to some core concepts of React from a JavaScript perspective. Hereâ€™s a summary of the JavaScript topics that will be mentioned:

- Functions and Arrow Functions
- Objects
- Arrays and array methods
- Destructuring
- Template literals
- Ternary Operators
- ES Modules and Import / Export Syntax

## React Core Concepts

There are three core concepts of React that you'll need to be familiar with to start building React applications. These are:

- Components
- Props
- State

## Building UI with Components

User interfaces can be broken down into smaller building blocks called components. This modularity allows your code to be more maintainable as it grows because you can easily add, update, and delete components without touching the rest of our application.

The nice thing about React components is that they are just JavaScript. Let's see how you can write a React component, from a JavaScript perspective:

### Creating components

In React, components are functions.
